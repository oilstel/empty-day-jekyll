"Social media is like the weather. It's always changing."

How often you check the weather? Once in the morning before they leave for work and maybe a second time if there's a sudden rainstorm or a blizzard?

# Hereâ€™s a prompt...

<div class="prompt">
Try checking social media as frequently as you would check the weather.

If you are using an iPhone, use screen time to compare how much time you spend on the built-in weather app to the time you spend on your most used social media app.
