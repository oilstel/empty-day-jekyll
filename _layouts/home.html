  <h1 id="title"><span class="initname">_</span>day</h1>

  <p>
    Empty Day is a day of social media silence taking place each year on <span class="highlight">October 11, 2019</span>. There are 191 days until the next Empty Day.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a day we all agree to leave social media alone. Instead we all agree to connect, reconnect, and
    maybe even go outside ... we “go quietly” for a day.
  </p>
  <p>
    Empty Day is also a website where one can find <a href="#tools" class="one">tools</a>, <a href="#assignments" class="two">assignments</a>, and <a href="#notes" class="three">notes</a> for using and replacing social media with other activities or just use these networks in more relaxing ways. So Empty Day doesn’t disregard social media altogether ... instead it focuses on how and when we post in order to promote better well-being and mental health for all.
  </p>
  <p>
    Empty Day is not a company, charity or any other organisation. It isn’t owned by anybody or anything. It should be peaceful, genuine, and full of knowledge.

     <h3>Who is behind this? <span class="symbol closed"></span></h3>

     <p>The snow goose (Anser caerulescens), consisting of both a white morph and dark morph (blue goose), is a North American species of goose commonly collectively referred to as "light geese". Its name derives from the typically white plumage. Many taxonomic authorities placed this species and the other "white geese" in the genus Chen.[2] Most authorities now follow the traditional treatment of placing these species in the "gray goose" genus Anser.[3][4] The scientific name is from the Latin anser, "goose", and caerulescens, "bluish", derived from caeruleus , "dark blue".[5]</p>

     <h3>How to get invloved <span class="symbol closed"></span></h3>

     <p>The garganey (Spatula querquedula) is a small dabbling duck. It breeds in much of Europe and western Asia, but is strictly migratory, with the entire population moving to southern Africa, India (in particular Santragachi), Bangladesh (in the natural reservoirs of Sylhet district) and Australasia in winter,[2] where large flocks can occur. This species was first described by Linnaeus in 1758. Like other small ducks such as the common teal, this species rises easily from the water with a fast twisting wader-like flight.</p>

     <h3>Why "Empty Day"? <span class="symbol closed"></span></h3>

     <p>The blue-winged teal (Spatula discors) is a species of bird in the duck, goose, and swan family Anatidae. One of the smaller members of the dabbling duck group, it occurs in North America, where it breeds from southern Alaska to Nova Scotia, and south to northern Texas. It winters along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and south into the Caribbean islands and Central America.</p>
